        "Bayesian statistics and Frequentist statistics both attempt to determine the likelihood of an event occuring. Bayesian takes into account a prior belief, which is typically how some secondary event occuring (or not) affects the probability that the event we're looking for will occur. A Frequentist approach does not take any priors into account. \n",
        "\n",
        "A Frequentist approach is best for events that are random and repeatable, i.e. events that are very easy to run multiple trials for, like dice rolls. A Bayesian approach is best for events that only happen once in a while, but there are a lot of other events affecting the outcome which we can determine, like a presidential election. \n",
        "\n",
        "We wouldn't want to use a Bayesian approach for dice rolls because if there are priors affecting the probability of the dice rolls, we should try to eliminate those instead of measuring them so that our rolls are fair. If we are attempting to prove the dice are fair, showing that priors exist which influence the probability of the dice rolls would be sufficient to prove the dice are not fair. \n",
        "\n",
        "We wouldn't want to use a Frequentist approach for attempting to predict the outcome of a presidential election because it's something that only happens every 4 years, so we can't measure it very often. More importantly, there is a ton of data (namely polls) that we can measure prior to the election occuring. We can use this data to predict the outcome of the election since we have the same type of data for previous elections. "
